## 👋 Hi, I'm Vlad
I am genuinely interested in working with data, analyzing trends, and translating complex information into clear, actionable insights.

My technical toolkit includes practical experience with:

* **Data Retrieval (SQL):** Hands-on practice using **PostgreSQL** for fundamental data querying, manipulation, and schema understanding.
* **Visualization:** Ability to transform analytical results into engaging and understandable visuals using **Tableau**.
* **Data Processing:** Proficient use of **Google Sheets / Microsoft Excel** for cleaning, organizing, and summarizing raw data.
* **Modern Efficiency:** Utilizing **AI assistants (Gemini, ChatGPT)** to significantly enhance code troubleshooting, research speed, and workflow efficiency.

I am eager to contribute my growing analytical skills to a professional team environment.
