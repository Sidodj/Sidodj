## 🔍 Data Analyst
I am genuinely interested in working with data, analyzing trends, and translating complex information into clear, actionable insights.

My technical toolkit includes practical experience with:

* **Visualization:** Ability to transform analytical results into engaging and understandable visuals using **Tableau** and **Google Sheets**.
* **Data Processing:** Proficient use of **Google Sheets / Microsoft Excel** for cleaning, organizing, and summarizing raw data.
